# cmpe273-lab3




The purpose of this lab is to understand how to implement a RESTful persistent key-value data store using Chronicle Map.



The limitation of the current implementation is the data will be lost whenever a node is goes down. To locally persist the data, you will use Chronicle Map to store the key-value hashmap into a file system.
